BunnyCMS
=============
I developed the BunnyCMS because I needed a simple and flexible tool in order to get my blog updated.  

Features
--------------------
* It is very simple and easy
* Highly customizable
* Front-end templates based on [Mustache Logic-less templates] (http://mustache.github.com/)
* You can choose between [WYSIWYG Editor](http://nicedit.com/) or [Markdown] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to edit your posts
* It is totally free

Installation
----------

The installation is very easy. All you have to do is:

1. Edit the file \application\config\production\application.php (line 3)
	'url' => 'bunnycms's url'

2. Edit the file \application\config\production\database.php with your database info.

3. Edit the permission of the folder /images.

4. Run the file bunny.sql in your database.

5. The enter at the administration area access http://BUNNY_URL/admin. The login is 'admin' and the password is also 'admin'. You can change it later.
